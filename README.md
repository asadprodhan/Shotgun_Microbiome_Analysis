# üß¨ Shotgun Microbiome Analysis  
**Analysis ‚Ä¢ Methodology ‚Ä¢ Visualisation ‚Ä¢ Hypothesis Testing**

This repository provides a **teaching-ready guide** to shotgun metagenomic microbiome analysis.  
It walks through **analysis steps, methods, visualisation techniques, and hypotheses tested**, including **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** profiling.

## 1. Data Processing & Quality Control
**Methodology**
- Check sequencing quality (FastQC, MultiQC).  
- Trim adapters & low-quality bases (Trimmomatic, fastp).  
- Remove host DNA by aligning to host genome (Bowtie2, BWA).  
- Keep high-quality reads for downstream analyses.  

**Visualisations**
- QC plots (per-base quality, GC content).  
- Read retention barplots (raw ‚Üí trimmed ‚Üí host-removed).  

**Hypotheses**
- Are sequencing depth and quality consistent across samples?  
- Do host reads disproportionately affect certain samples?  

---

## 2. Taxonomic Composition
**Methodology**
- Assign taxonomy using k-mer‚Äìbased (Kraken2, Bracken) or marker-based (MetaPhlAn) classifiers.  
- Generate relative abundance tables at phylum/genus/species levels.  

**Visualisations**
- Stacked barplots of taxa.  
- Heatmaps of abundance.  
- Krona charts for interactive hierarchical views.  

**Hypotheses**
- Do microbial communities differ in composition between groups (e.g., healthy vs diseased)?  
- Tests: PERMANOVA, ANOSIM, DESeq2, ANCOM, MaAsLin2.  

---

## 3. Diversity Analyses
**Methodology**
- **Alpha diversity**: Shannon, Simpson, Chao1 indices.  
- **Beta diversity**: Distance matrices (Bray‚ÄìCurtis, Jaccard, UniFrac).  
- Ordination methods: PCoA, PCA, NMDS.  

**Visualisations**
- Boxplots of alpha diversity.  
- PCoA/PCA ordination plots.  
- Dendrograms.  

**Hypotheses**
- Is within-sample diversity (alpha) different between groups?  
- Is between-sample variation (beta) greater across conditions?  
- Tests: Mann‚ÄìWhitney, Kruskal‚ÄìWallis, PERMANOVA.  

---

## 4. Differential Abundance
**Methodology**
- Normalise counts (library size correction, CLR transformation).  
- Apply statistical models (DESeq2, LEfSe, ANCOM, MaAsLin2).  

**Visualisations**
- Volcano plots.  
- Heatmaps of significant taxa.  
- LEfSe cladograms.  

**Hypotheses**
- Which taxa are enriched or depleted under certain conditions?  

---

## 5. Functional Profiling
**Methodology**
- Assign gene families (eggNOG, KEGG orthologs).  
- Aggregate into pathways (MetaCyc, KEGG modules).  
- Quantify pathway abundances (HUMAnN3).  

**Visualisations**
- Heatmaps of pathway abundance.  
- Barplots of differential pathways.  
- Bubble plots for enrichment.  

**Hypotheses**
- Do microbial functions differ significantly between conditions?  
- Are certain metabolic pathways enriched in disease states?  
- Tests: GSEA, Fisher‚Äôs exact, regression models.  

---

## 6. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Analysis
**Methodology**
- Map reads/contigs against AMR gene databases (CARD, ResFinder, ARG-ANNOT, MEGARes).  
- Quantify resistance genes by class and mechanism.  
- Normalise by sequencing depth (RPKM, CPM).  

**Visualisations**
- Barplots of AMR gene classes.  
- Heatmaps of resistance genes across samples.  
- Network diagrams of AMR gene‚Äìtaxa associations.  

**Hypotheses**
- Are AMR genes more abundant in treatment vs control groups?  
- Do certain environments (e.g., hospital wastewater vs soil) carry distinct AMR profiles?  
- Tests: DESeq2, MaAsLin2, correlation with metadata.  

---

## 7. Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs)
**Methodology**
- Assemble reads (MEGAHIT, metaSPAdes).  
- Bin contigs (MetaBAT, MaxBin, CONCOCT).  
- Assess quality (CheckM, BUSCO).  
- Annotate taxonomy & function.  

**Visualisations**
- Phylogenetic trees of MAGs.  
- Completeness vs contamination scatterplots.  
- Heatmaps of genome abundance.  

**Hypotheses**
- Are specific genomes enriched in certain environments?  
- Do MAGs carry unique functions or AMR genes?  

---

## 8. Correlation & Network Analysis
**Methodology**
- Correlate taxa/functions with metadata (Spearman, Pearson, SparCC).  
- Build co-occurrence networks.  

**Visualisations**
- Correlation heatmaps.  
- Microbial association networks.  

**Hypotheses**
- Do certain microbes co-occur or exclude each other?  
- Are microbial associations altered under specific conditions?  

---

## 9. Machine Learning & Predictive Modelling
**Methodology**
- Feature selection (taxa, pathways).  
- Train classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, neural networks).  
- Evaluate with cross-validation.  

**Visualisations**
- ROC and PR curves.  
- Feature importance plots.  

**Hypotheses**
- Can microbiome features predict host phenotype or environment?  
- Which features are most predictive?
